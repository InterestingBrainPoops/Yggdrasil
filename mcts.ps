/*
Selection
Selecting good child nodes, starting from the root node R, that represent states leading to better overall outcome (win).

Expansion
If L is a not a terminal node (i.e. it does not end the game), then create one or more child nodes and select one (C).

Simulation (rollout)
Run a simulated playout from C until a result is achieved.

Backpropagation
Update the current move sequence with the simulation result.
